Project Completion Date:
- Projected: BY SRS POSTER PRESENTATION 4/18/2023
- Actual Completion: _________________________________


Project Initiated (2/11/2023)


Reminders:
- Needs Development
    - Blur Function (Average four points in matrix)
    - Limb Darkening
    + Make sure Chord Length of atmosphere (therefore intensity) is properly calculated
    + Fix light curve
    + Organize equations sheet
    - Correct calculation of Watts/m^2
    + Writing (presentation/poster)
    + Calibration of data
    - Atmospheric Lensing
    

Summary (2/11/2023 - 2/18/2023):
Attempt 1_Explanet_Transity 
- Created void-star-planet-atmosphere system with changable variables
    - Void:
        - Variables: Radius, Intensity = 0
    - Star:
        - Simplified Gradient
        - Variables: Radius, intensity, position (relative to Void)
    - Exoplanet:
        - Creates 0 intensity in Void at specific position
        - Variables: Radius, intensity = 0, position (relative to center Star)
    - Atmosphere:
        - Creates defined intensity in Void at specific position
        - Variables: Radius, intensity
- Prints intensity matrix as image
- Creates basic Light Curve as Exoplanet and Atmosphere passes in front of Star




Notes: (2/11/2023)
- Michael reset Anaconda on his laptop
- Began Model Development (Attempt 1_Exoplanet_Transiting)
    - Developed basic call functions for star and exoplanet
    - Developed basic square-array overall to depict luminosity of the system.

~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Development (Attempt 1_Exoplanet_Transiting)
    - Developed basic call function for void (blackness)
    - Developed basic distance formula (for circular stars/exoplanets)
    - Developed basic output of Gray-Scale representation of void intensity array 
        - From Matrix to plot: (0,1) -> (Black, White)
        - Can be at least 600x600 array; Very fast if matrix is not printed
    - Changed position vector of Star/Exoplanet to be on the center of the object



Notes: (2/12/2023)
- Researched Limb Darkening (didn't understand how to implement possible equation)

~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement
    - Developed intensity gradiant for the star (intensity = z for sphere equation)
        - Creates dome/contour of values, strongest at the center of the star
            - r = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2+(z2-z1)^2) where r, x2, y2, z2 = radius/2, x1 = i, y1 = j
            - intensity_new = intensity_max/(radius/2)*(abs((radius/2-abs(i))**2+(radius/2-abs(j))**2-radius**2/4+radius/2)**(1/2)) // [1]
    - Attempted Development on Limb Darkening 
        - Failed, very difficult to impliment
        - Necessary for accurate model
        - Assumed equation light intensity to be to the **(1/8) instead **(1/2) // [1]
            - Slightly more accurate
    - Developed Basic Light Curve idea
        - Summation of entire intensity array matrix (IAM) over initial IAM
        - Move planet over a unit
        - Read into vector and repeat
        - Plot entire vector against time
        - Needs improvement (4 minutes for 500 points, with 600x600 IAM)



Notes: (2/13/2023)
- Ryan Norris mentioned to keep the model simple; do not use the Limb Darkening Equation at this moment

~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement:
    - Developed basic atmosphere for intensity graph (very simple)
    - Integrated atmosphere into the Light Curve model



Notes: (2/17/2023)
- Meeting with Ryan Norris
    - Gaia/Tess Interface
        - Parameters of Stars
            - Temperature, Radius, Inclination
        - Parameters of Planetary Systems
            - Radius, Orbit Radius, Albedo
    - Mess with model to best of fit with known data (verify)
        - What is necessary to detect this
    - Main point: best fit data
    - Books with some equations
        - Planetary Sciences: Pages -[494-Transit]
        - Foundations of Astrophysics: Pages-[195-Albedo / 300-General]
    - Determine key parameters to fit model (?)
    - Increase with input parameter & Input to more physical things
    - For User interface: 'input' command
    
creating transit parameterization tool
could apply precision to detect the proper atmosphere

    - Think about what needs to be done


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Attempt 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Notes: (2/25/2023)
~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement in Attempt 2
    - Changed name Radius to Diameter for clarity
    - Included some Markdown equations
        - Apparent brightness given temperature, radius (star), and distance
    - Attempted to impliment units into IAM (not too successful)
    - Changed input of Star to include: distance (lyr), diameter (km), resolution (matrix size), position, and temperature (K)
    - Ended with error in output of Intensity array



Notes: (2/26/2023)
~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement in Attempt 2
    - Impliment units into IAM more efficiently (needs work)
    - Changed input of...
        - ... Star to:                 [distance (lyr), diameter (km), resolution (matrix size), position (relative to void), and temperature (K)]
        - ... Exoplanet to:            [diameter (km), position (relative to Star)]
        - ... Exoplanet Atmosphere to: [strength intensity (0-1), height from Exoplanet (km)]
    - Ended with error in Light Curve
    - Added Errors.txt for helping with common errors
    - Implement proper scale to matrix function

- Dr. Bert Kerr helped with finding chord length of a circle given polar equation for a line and a circle
    - Given (x-d)^2+y^2 = R^2 & y = xtan(theta)



Notes: (3/4/2023)
~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement in Attempt 2
    - Added Markdown equations for chord length given two circles
    - Changed input of ... Exoplanet Atmosphere to: [strength intensity (0-1), inner height from Exoplanet (km), outer height (km)]
    - Attempted chord length calculation for sphere (atmosphere/cloud debris)
        - Many, many errors (NANs)
    - Changed all round() to m.ceil()
    - Ended with many NANs in final IA



Notes: (3/6/2023)
~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement in Attempt 2
    - Finished chord length calculation for sphere (works without breaking)
        - IA chord calculation may be correct
        


Notes: (3/13/2023)
~~ Updates:
- Continued Model Developement in Attempt 2
    - IA chord calculation is not correct
        - Maybe do 
- Did more research
    - Atmospheric Lensing (Intensity will be more that 1 [shoulders of light curve])
    - Refraction Gradient
