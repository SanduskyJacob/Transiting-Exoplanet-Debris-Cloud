Error Helper for (possible) common problems that took a while:

Cross On Output Matrix:
    Intensity Array has extreme intensities at horizontal and vertical
        Do round(resolution)
            - ...self.resolution = round(star1.resolution * self.diameter / star1.diameter)


Checkered Board Pattern:
    Intensity Array is reading the incorrect value from the star IA 
        Changed how final void IA is calculated
            - ...black.intensity_array[i,j] = black.intensity_array[i,j] + EP1DC.intensity_array[i-EP1DCoffseti,j-EP1DCoffsetj]


Fade On Star from Planet/Atmosphere:
    Misalligned assignment of IA to specific Planet/Atmosphere Intensity Array
        Do abs(i) & abs(j) rather than i & j within the reassignment
            - ...self.intensity_array[i,j] = star1.intensity_array[abs(i) + self.position[0] - star1.position[0],abs(j) + self.position[1] - star1.position[1]]


NAN in Intensity Array:
    Viewing angle is outside of debris cloud, therefore line does not intersect
        Change angle to include {changed resolution * diameter / total resolution} 
            - ...angularDegree = angularDiameterDegree((abs(((self.resolution/2-abs(i))**2+(self.resolution/2-abs(j))**2))**(1/2))*self.outerDiameter/self.resolution, self.distance)
    Viewing angle is equal to zero (???)
        Change angle from zero to close to zero
            - ...if round(angle,4) == 0: angle = 0.000009
    Square Root of a Negative Number
        Change square roots to include abs()
            - ...abs((distance*u.lyr+(distance**2*(u.lyr**2)-(1+m.tan(m.radians(angle))**2)
                    *(distance**2*(u.lyr**2)-radius**2*(u.km**2)))**(1/2)))
    Circles and NANs if statement
        If output is not NAN, and within circle bounds, continue with calculations
            - ...if (m.isnan(angularDegree) == False) & ((abs(((self.resolution/2-abs(i))**2+(self.resolution/2-abs(j))**2))**(1/2)) <= self.resolution/2):
